# react-parcel-demo
A demo application in react with parcel bundler. I will extend this applications further more to implement transform modules such as Babel, PostCSS and also code splitting.

# Parcel
Parcel (https://parceljs.org) is a zero configuration bundler for web application similar to Webpack 4. It looks like Parcel is easy to bundle for small applications compared to Webpack3/4.  
## Run
npm install

parcel start index.html (for dev)

parcel build index.html  (for build/production)
```
